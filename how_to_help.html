        <p class="row-section-1-content">You may be wondering, "How can I help to stand against bullying in my community?". There are a few ways that you can make a difference. One way is by starting a club or group of others and spread your message with your peers. This way works best in schools or other environments with a lot of other people. Another way that you can enact change is by writing a letter to a significant member of your community/school. You write a letter to them talking about how bullying is affecting your environment and ask them to create/enforce some rules against bullying. You could also contact a principal or counselor in your school.</p>

        <p class="row-section-2-content">While I offered some solutions for in person, I haven't mentioned anything about cyber-bullying. For cyber-bullying, there are a couple of solutions. One of those solutions is by cutting off contact or ignoring the bully. Another way to stop cyber-bullying is making sure that you keep personal information safe and don't share everything online. This can lead to people coming to your posts or your page and bullying or making fun of you. If you know someone being bullied or bullying someone, you can call the Stop Bullying Now Hotline at 1-800-273-8255. They are available 24/7.</p>
